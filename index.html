            <article>
            <p>Michael Ong is a second generation artist especially known for his unusually vivacious drawings and fluid sculptures. His work is characterized by deceptively simple sharply defined abstract forms that flow effortlessly from one intricate view to the next. </p>
            <p>After completing his art studies at the prestigious R.M.I.T. University in Melbourne and later a Masters in Industrial Design in the early 1970s, he returned to Singapore. He was active in the Sculpture Society and informal art groups like ‘Group 90’ (founded by Brother Joseph McNally). In 1984, Michael was selected to represent Singapore at the 4 ASEAN Sculpture Symposium in Brunei and he created a monumental piece which stands towering over Asian Square.</p>
