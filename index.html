            <article>
            <p>Michael Ong is a second generation artist especially known for his unusually vivacious drawings and fluid sculptures. His work is characterized by deceptively simple sharply defined abstract forms that flow effortlessly from one intricate view to the next. </p>
            <p><em>”I am inspired by the idea of looking, especially at the organic. My parallel work in over several decades of life drawing has enabled me to smoothly transit from observation and conception, to production.”</em></p>
